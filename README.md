Questions 
 1_clean_data
    Why exclude loci not placed on a chromosome?
    
    Why is it import to consider Hardy-Weinberg equalibrium, and the genotyping rate of each locus?
    
    What are the sample sizes and number of loci used in each analysis?
    
 2_do_PCA &  3_plot_PCA
  Why is it useful to explore your data before and after filtering steps?
  What does each dot represent?  What is summarize by the PCA projection?
  Describe the differences between the two PCAs (before and after filtering).  How are they different?  How are they similar?
  What is a biological interpretation of the Puget_EVEN individual that clusters close to the the Koppen_EVEN individuals?
  
    
4_calculate_r2
  What does the r2 statistic measure?  How is r2 related to LD?
  
  Why is it often important to remove very low frequency allelels when summarizing LD?
  Which population has the most LD?
  How does sample size affect LD?
  
5_estimate_Ne

6_plot_Ne
  Which population do you expect to have the most genetic drift?, the least?
  

  
Perspectives
  Do you think sample size was important?  How would two samples that were siblings affect your Ne estiamtes?
  How does this analysis relate to the LD in Mountain and Western Lowland Gorillas?
  How would recent migration into a population affect genetic estimates of LD?
